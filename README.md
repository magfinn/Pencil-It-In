<h2><i>a daily workday planner</i></h2>
<br><br>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This planner is for those with an 8-5 or 9-5 schedule who wish to input their tasks for the current day and track their progress throughout the workday. </p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>The Technical Stuff</h3>
<p>This planner uses Luxon for date/time queries. Starter code included moment.js which is considered a legacy project. <br>
Each task is saved for the current day. At 6pm, the localStorage is cleaned and the tasks disappear. <br>
The time is color coordinated:
<ul>
<li>grey: time past</li>
<li>red: current time</li>
<li>green: future time</li>
</ul>
<br>
